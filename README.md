HTML

HTML file consists mostly from div elements which doesn't meet accessibility standards.
 When I view the source code I saw possibility of replace "div" elements with semantic HTML elements.That also helped achieving logical structure independent of styling and positioning. 
 When I view the image elements alt attributes were missing so I added them.
 When I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order.
 When I view the title element it didn't define the title of the document.
 Then I replace existing title element with  a concise, descriptive title.

CSS

CSS file had a lot of repetitive code. To achieve cleaner code I created classes for elements with same properties and values. Then I removed repetitive code.
